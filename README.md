# Urban Sound Classification with Artificial Intelligence

## üìã Brief description and context

The increasing urbanization of cities has made sound pollution a significant concern for public health. Recognizing this, I collaborated with **Orange Business Digital Services** to design an innovative system for urban sound classification using **deep learning**. This initiative aimed to enhance the monitoring and management of sound pollution in smart cities, particularly in Brussels.

The project leveraged advanced machine learning techniques to classify urban sounds into meaningful categories, facilitating better decision-making for urban planning and noise management. The final solution involved integrating multiple data sources, preprocessing audio data, and developing convolutional neural network models.
